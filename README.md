## üöÄ How to use

- Install with `yarn` or `npm install`.
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to try it out.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Pitch
RankIt is a React Native app that empowers users to rank anything and everything imaginable, from movies and restaurants to running routes to wine and beyond.  
With an AI powered intuitive search functionality, users can easily discover and explore the items they wish to rank.

Think of it like a cross between Reddit, Tiktok and Yelp.  
For example, a user could rank a movie they just saw like Dune 2, or a resturant they just went to, or a wine they just tried. This app should be the one stop shop for all ranking by gamifying/socializing it.

## üìù Notes (raw)
- This was inspired by recent apps that operate off a ranking-based engagement model. Apps like Beli or Letterboxd operate entirely off rankings and entice users via simple rating schemes.  
- Beli uses "this vs that" (which I love) ranking to determine a score whereas Letterboxd uses a simple 0-5 scale. This app will let the user choose their type of ranking system to add some customization.  

- The hypothesis is people love to share their opinions with the world **if it's easy**. Some services make it hard with no reward (looking at you Google Maps). If it's easy, integrates some form of anonimity/privacy and has a reward, the funnel opens up.  
- Plus, this would be creating a collection of users favorite *everythings*, from songs, to favorite movies, to favorite wines etc etc. I believe this is powerful. Adding your honest thoughts about it lets the user get one level deeper and acts as a psuedo experience diary.

- Reddit is intriguing to me because they allow the creation of all types of subreddits. 
  - There are subreddits for r/MacOS and there are subreddits for r/MacOSReviews. The depth of specificity is entirely up to users. If users like a certain depth, they will join the subreddit and it will be elevated.  
  - This will be similar where a user could rank "Dune 2", or they could rank "Dune 2 Acting". The most poignant one for the community will be elevated based on engagement.  
Users are incentivized to create rankings and rank others similar to the reddit model, where you earn prestige and share your thoughts, and eventually unlock some extra functionality.  

- Beli is particularlly interesting since they offer new functionality not as a monetization tactic but as an engagement and retention tactic. 
  - New functionality (ie. reccomendations) are only unlocked after you rank/review X number of items, providing an incentive for deeper usage/engagement and a reason to stay after you've hit that depth of usage.  
  - This app will operate similar to that.
